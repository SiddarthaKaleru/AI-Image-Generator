**AI Image Generator**

The AI Image Generator is a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) that enables users to generate high-quality images from text prompts. Leveraging the Clipdrop API for text-to-image generation, this project allows users to input creative prompts and receive unique images in response. MongoDB stores user-generated images and prompt data, while Express.js and Node.js handle server-side operations. React provides a dynamic and responsive user interface, making it easy for users to interact with the image generation features. This project demonstrates the integration of AI-powered image generation with a modern web development stack.
